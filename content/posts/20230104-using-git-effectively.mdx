Or, if you want to see the lines that changed

```
git lg -p
```

### Resetting options

`git reset`: move a branch pointer to point to a different commit

* `--soft`: keep the current files on disk and in the staging area
* `--mixed`: keep the current files on disk, but clear the staging area
* `--hard`: clear the staging area *and* make the working directory look exactly like this specific commit

### Reverting commits

`git revert`: creates new commits with the "opposite" changes of the commits you want to undo

### Rebasing Branches

`git rebase`: rewrite the history of a branch so that it starts from a different base commit than it did originally

### Git Internal Data Structures

*Look like a "blockchain"*

* Because commits are a linked list based on hashes, and the hashes are based on byte contents of files and other structures, changing any one bit in an earlier commit would have a ripple effect - every hash of each commit after that would be different.
* Git commit objects are *immutable* - once created, they cannot actually be changed
* This means that you can't *change* history, exactly - you can only create an *alternate* history
