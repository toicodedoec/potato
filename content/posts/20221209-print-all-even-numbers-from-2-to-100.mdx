```python
def​ ​print_numbers_version_one​():
​ 	  number = 2
​ 	
​ 	  ​while​ number <= 100:
​ 	    ​# If number is even, print it:​
​ 	    ​if​ number % 2 == 0:
​ 	      ​print​(number)
​ 	
​ 	    number += 1
```

```python
def​ ​print_numbers_version_two​():
​ 	  number = 2
​ 	
​ 	  ​while​ number <= 100:
​ 	    ​print​(number)
​ 	
​ 	    ​# Increase number by 2, which, by definition,​
​ 	    ​# is the next even number:​
​ 	    number += 2
```

Version 1 ends up looping 100 times, while Version 2 only loops 50 times. The first version then, takes twice as many steps as the second version.
