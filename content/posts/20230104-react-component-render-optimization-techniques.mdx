=================

A component render is considered "wasted" if it returns the same requested elements as before. Normally, `UI = f(props + state)`, so if props and state haven't changed, the UI output *should* be the same.

We can optimize performance by skipping component renders if props haven't changed. This also skips the entire *subtree* of that component.

* **Primary**: wrap a component with the `React.memo()` higher-order component

  * Automatically checks for props changes with "shallow equality" comparison
  * Accepts a custom comparison callback as an option
* Class components: `shouldComponentUpdate` or `React.PureComponent`

=================

```javascript
// ❌ BAD!
// Antipattern: Creating components in render function
// This creates a new `ChildComponent` reference every time!
function ParentComponent() {
  function ChildComponent() {    
    return <div>Hi</div>
  }
  
  return <ChildComponent />
}

// ✅ GOOD
// This only creates one component type reference
function ChildComponent() {
  return <div>Hi</div>
}

function ParentComponent() {
  return <ChildComponent />
}

// ✅ GOOD
// Use props.children
function Parent({children}) {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0)

  // Consistent `props.children` element reference as state changes
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
      {children}
    </div>
  )
}

// later
return <Parent><SomeChild /></Parent>
  
// ✅ GOOD
// Use useMemo to save an element reference
function ComponentA({data}) {
  // Consistent `ChildComponent` element reference
  const memoizedChild = useMemo(() => {
    return <ChildComponent data={data} />;
  }, [data])

  return <div>{memoizedChild}</div>
}
```

### Antipattern: Creating components in render function

Creating components inside render function of another component is an anti-pattern that can be the biggest performance killer. On every re-render React will re-mount this component (i.e. destroy it and re-create it from scratch), which is going to be much slower than a normal re-render. On top of that, this will lead to such bugs as:

* possible “flashes” of content during re-renders
* state being reset in the component with every re-render
* useEffect with no dependencies triggered on every re-render
* if a component was focused, focus will be lost

### Immutability and Rerendering

`React.memo()` does "shallow equality" checks like `props.someValue !== prevProps.someValue`, assuming immutable updates will change references. Hooks with dependencies (`useMemo/useCallback/useEffect`) work similarly. 

If you mutate, then someValue is the same reference, and those components will assume nothing has changed.

In addition: **`useState` and `useReducer` expect *new* state references in order to re-render. If you pass in the *same* state reference, React will bail out of the update!**

**React, and the rest of the React ecosystem, assume immutable updates. Any time you mutate, you run the risk of bugs. Don't do it!!!**
