As you probably recall, dictionaries differ from lists in that you can access items in a dictionary by a key rather than a position. 

The thing that is most important to notice right now is that the `get item` and `set item` operations on a dictionary are *O(1)*. Another important dictionary operation is the `contains` operation. Checking to see whether a key is in the dictionary or not is also *O(1)*.

One important side note on dictionary performance is that the efficiencies we provide in the table are for average performance. In some rare cases the `contains`, `get item`, and `set item` operations can degenerate into *O(N)* performance.
