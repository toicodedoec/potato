Assume the infix expression is a string of tokens delimited by spaces. The operator tokens are ·, /, +, and -, along with the left and right parentheses, ( and ). The operand tokens are the single-character identifiers A, B, C, and so on. The following steps will produce a string of tokens in postfix order.

1. Create an empty stack called `op_stack` for keeping operators. Create an empty list for output.
2. Convert the input infix string to a list by using the string method `split`.
3. Scan the token list from left to right.

   * If the token is an operand, append it to the end of the output list.
   * If the token is a left parenthesis, push it on the `op_stack`.
   * If the token is a right parenthesis, pop the `op_stack` until the corresponding left parenthesis is removed. Append each operator to the end of the output list.
   * If the token is an operator, ·, /, +, or -, push it on the `op_stack`. However, first remove any operators already on the `op_stack` that have higher or equal precedence and append them to the output list.
4. When the input expression has been completely processed, check the `op_stack`. Any operators still on the stack can be removed and appended to the end of the output list.
