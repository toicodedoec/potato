#### Issue 1: The tutorial was published 2 years ago, so some version issues you have to solve

```
rollup/package.json

engines": {
    "node": ">=14.18.0",
    "npm": ">=8.0.0"
  },
```

#### Issue 2: TypeError: dts is not a function

#### Issue 3: Could not find module 'tslib'

> \[!] (plugin typescript) RollupError: @rollup/plugin-typescript: Could not find module 'tslib', which is required by this plugin. Is it installed?

You need [tslib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tslib), which is a [peer dependency](https://github.com/rollup/rollup-plugin-typescript#installation) of `rollup-plugin-typescript`.

```
npm i -D tslib
```

#### Issue 4: Github package registry or NPM registry

Downside of Github package registry

* Installing packages from GitHub won’t be supported by the `npm` command-line interface (CLI) by default. You will first need to authenticate with GitHub using `npm login` or store your user token in your local `.npmrc` configuration file.
* All packages served by GitHub are scoped. That means when you install a package, you’ll always have to use the organization or owner name as part of the command, such as `npm install @oktadev/super-cool-package`. You won’t be able to simply type `npm install super-cool-package`.

Rename the package: https://github.com/actions/setup-node/issues/269

#### Issue 5: NPM login

```
npm login
npm adduser
npm whoami
```
