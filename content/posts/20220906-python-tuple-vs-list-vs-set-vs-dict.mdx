Tuples are very similar to lists in that they are heterogeneous sequences of data. The difference is that a tuple is immutable, like a string.

A tuple can't be changed.

Tuples are written as comma-delimited values enclosed in parentheses.

```python
>>> my_tuple = (2, True, 4.96)
>>> my_tuple
(2, True, 4.96)
>>> len(my_tuple)
3
>>> my_tuple[0]
2
>>> my_tuple * 3
(2, True, 4.96, 2, True, 4.96, 2, True, 4.96)
>>> my_tuple[0:2]
(2, True)
```

Sets are heterogeneous as well and written as comma-delimeted values enclosed in curly braces.

```python
>>> {3, 6, "cat", 4.5, False}
{False, 3, 4.5, 6, 'cat'}
>>> my_set = {3, 6, "cat", 4.5, False}
>>> my_set
{False, 3, 4.5, 6, 'cat'}
```

Sets are unordered structure.
