title: Understand the LIST

Two common operations are indexing and assigning to an index position. Both of these operations take the same amount of time no matter how large the list becomes. When an operation like this is independent of the size of the list, it is *O(1)*.

Another very common programming task is to grow a list. There are two ways to create a LONGER list. You can use the ***append*** method or the concatenation operator. The ***append*** method is *O(1).* However, the concatenation operator is *O(k)* where *k* is the size of the list that is being concatenated.

```
def test1():
    l = []
    for i in range(1000):
        l = l + [i]


def test2():
    l = []
    for i in range(1000):
        l.append(i)


def test3():
    l = [i for i in range(1000)]


def test4():
    l = list(range(1000))
```

```
from timeit import Timer


t1 = Timer("test1()", "from __main__ import test1")
print(f"concatenation: {t1.timeit(number=1000):15.2f} milliseconds")
t2 = Timer("test2()", "from __main__ import test2")
print(f"appending: {t2.timeit(number=1000):19.2f} milliseconds")
t3 = Timer("test3()", "from __main__ import test3")
print(f"list comprehension: {t3.timeit(number=1000):10.2f} milliseconds")
t4 = Timer("test4()", "from __main__ import test4")
print(f"list range: {t4.timeit(number=1000):18.2f} milliseconds")

concatenation:           6.54 milliseconds
appending:               0.31 milliseconds
list comprehension:      0.15 milliseconds
list range:              0.07 milliseconds
