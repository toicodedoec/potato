**2 problems:**

Encryption: you send the information, even if everybody can see it, only the right eyes can understand it

Authentication: we're talking to the right person?

**Encryption**

You have 2 keys, if one is used to encrypt, the other one decrypts, and vice versa;

so you have to keep one of them private and distribute the other;

that way anybody who wants to communicate with you can encrypt data using your public key and only you can decrypt it using its associated private key;

**Authentication**

Story: my dad has a friend, that person hires a housekeeper; now that person mentions that if I hire the housekeeper as well, she would be very trustworthy and responsible; I agree to hire her;

A woman I don't know now enters my house three times a week. Why? Because I trust her. But why do I trust her? Because I trust my dad's friend, not really the landlord — but I trust my dad and he told me the landlord is trustworthy. So you can begin to see a chain of trust forming here. I trust my father, my father trusts the landlord, the landlord trusts the housekeeper. Therefore, I trust the housekeeper.

My dad is a Root Certificate Authority (Root CA). Often your web browsers or Operating Systems will come preinstalled with a set of Root CAs, and will trust whatever those CAs (Certificate Authority) trust.

The landlord is an Intermediate CA. I trust him because I trust the Root CA (my dad).

The Housekeeper is the entity whose identity I’m trying to establish. She will refer me to the landlord and my dad in order to ask for my trust.
