The only thing you can return from the useEffect hook is ***a cleanup function***. This function will run when the component unmounts.

```
useEffect(() => {
  doSomething();
  
  return () => {
    console.log("This will be logged on unmount");
  }
 }
```

You will get some error like *Uncaught TypeError: destroy is not a function* if you return anything else rather than a cleanup function, like:

```
useEffect(() => doSomething())
```

Why this one works?

```
useEffect(() => {
  doSomething();
});
```

The arrow function returns ***undefined***, which is acceptable and tells React that there is no cleanup function needed.
