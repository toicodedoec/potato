2^3 is the equivalent of:

2 \* 2 \* 2

which just happens to be 8.

Now, log2(8) is the converse. It means: how many times do you have to multiply 2 by itself to get a result of 8?

Because you have to multiply 2 by itself 3 times to get 8, log2(8) = 3.

Another way of explaining log2(8) is: if we keep dividing 8 by 2 until we end up with 1, how many 2s would we have in our equation?

8 / 2 / 2 / 2 = 1

In other words, how many times do we need to halve 8 until we end up with 1? In this example, it takes us three times. Therefore,

log2(8) = 3.
