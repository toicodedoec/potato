**Memoization** means the optimization technique where you memorize previously computed results, which will be used whenever the same result will be needed.

**Dynamic programming (DP)** means solving problems recursively by combining the solutions to similar smaller overlapping subproblems, usually using some kind of recurrence relations.

Nowadays I would interpret "dynamic" as meaning "moving from smaller subproblems to bigger subproblems". (The word "programming" refers to the use of the method to find an optimal program, as in "linear programming". People like me treat it as in software programming sometimes)
